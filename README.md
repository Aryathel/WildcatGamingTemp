# Python Discord Bot Template
This is the template that I use when creating a new Discord Bot. Feel free to use it however you would like.

# Getting Started
To use this template, create your own Github repo, and in the creation menu select the "Choose a template" dropdown, then search for PythonDiscordBotTemplate and select the one that I have created. Then, simply clone the repository to your workspace, edit the `Config.yml` and `Permissions.yml` files, and start coding.
